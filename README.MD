# Tentris: A Tensor-based Triple Store

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/dice-group/tentris.svg)](https://travis-ci.com/dice-group/tentris)

<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Tentris</span> is a triple store to query RDF data using SPARQL. 
It is based on tensors and tensor algebra. 
Currently, it supports SELECT queries with or without DISTINCT and a WHERE-bock with triple patterns.

Further SPARQL features will follow.   

## running tentris 
Tentris provides two ways of running it. Either as a HTTP endpoint or as a interactive commandline tool. Make sure you build Tentris successfully, before proceeding below.
### HTTP endpoint
#### start
To start Tentris as a HTTP endpoint run
```
tentris_server -p 8090 -f my_nt_file.nt
```
to load the data from the provided `.nt` file and serve SPARQL endpoint at port 8090. 
For more options commandline options see ` tentris_server --help`. 

#### query
The endpoint may now be queried locally at: `127.0.0.1:8090/sparql?query=*your query*`. 

*Notice*: the query string `*your query*` must be URL encoded. 
You can use any online URL encoder like <https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/dencoder>.   

*currently deactivated*: ~~An additional endpoint is provided at `127.0.0.1:8090/stream` using chunk encoded HTTP response. This endpoint should be used for very large responses (>1mio results).~~ 


#### usage example

Consider the query below against a [SPÂ²Bench](http://dbis.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/forschung/projekte/SP2B/) data set:
``` 
PREFIX rdf:   <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX bench: <http://localhost/vocabulary/bench/>

SELECT DISTINCT ?article
WHERE {
  ?article rdf:type bench:Article .
  ?article ?property ?value 
}
```

To run the query start Tentris with: 
```
tentris_server -p 3030 -f sp2b.nt 
```
You can find a populated sp2b.nt file in [tests/dataset/sp2b.nt](tests/dataset/sp2b.nt).

now, visit the follwing IRI in a browser to send the query to your Tentris endpoint:

<http://127.0.0.1:3030/sparql?query=PREFIX%20rdf%3A%20%20%20%3Chttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F1999%2F02%2F22-rdf-syntax-ns%23%3E%0APREFIX%20bench%3A%20%3Chttp%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%2Fvocabulary%2Fbench%2F%3E%0A%0ASELECT%20DISTINCT%20%3Farticle%0AWHERE%20%7B%0A%20%20%3Farticle%20rdf%3Atype%20bench%3AArticle%20.%0A%20%20%3Farticle%20%3Fproperty%20%3Fvalue%20%0A%7D>

## commandline tool

For small experiments it is sometimes more convenient to use a commandline tool for querying an RDF graph. 
Therefore, Tentris provides a commandline interface.  

To start Tentris as a interactive commandline tool, run:
```
tentris_terminal -f my_nt_file.nt
```

After the RDF data from `my_nt_file.nt` is loaded, you type your query and hit ENTER. After the result was printed, you can enter your next query. 

For more commandline options see `tentris_terminal --help`.

## prerequisites

### build tools

Tentris is known to build successfully on Ubuntu 18.10 and newer. 
Building was tested with GCC 8 and clang 7.

The following packages are required to build tentris:
```
sudo apt install build-essential uuid-dev g++ git openjdk-8-jdk python3-pip python3-setuptools python3-wheel
```

Since ANTLR4 has problems with recent cmake releases, we suggest using this specific version:
```
pip3 install --user cmake==3.13.3
```

Additionally, a recent version of conan is required: 
```
pip3 install --user conan
```

### dependencies
The required dependencies are installed via conan. Therefore, Add the respective remotes:
```bash
conan remote add tsl https://api.bintray.com/conan/tessil/tsl && conan remote add public-conan https://api.bintray.com/conan/bincrafters/public-conan && conan remote add stiffstream https://api.bintray.com/conan/stiffstream/public && conan remote add dice-research https://api.bintray.com/conan/dice-group/tentris
```
## build
After you installed all dependencies, you are ready to build Tentris. 
Make sure you are connected to the internet as Tentris downloads things at several points throughout the build processes.

If you did not so far, clone Tentris:
```
git clone https://github.com/dice-group/tentris.git
```
Make sure you are in the cloned folder:
```
cd tentris
```
Now, make a build directory and enter it.
```bash
mkdir build 
cd build
```
Get and build the dependencies with conan:
```bash
conan install .. --build=missing --settings compiler.libcxx="libstdc++11"
```
Generate the build skripts with CMAKE and run the build:
```bash
cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .. 
make -j tentris_server tentris_terminal
```
Now is the time to get yourself a coffee. In about 
When you build Tentris for the first time, it will take some time. 

The binaries will be located at `tentris/build/bin`. 

## debug and tests
To compile Tentris with debugging symbols, proceed as above but change the cmake command to `cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug .. `.

To compile the tests, run `cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DTENTRIS_BUILD_TESTS=True .. ` for debugging or `cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DTENTRIS_BUILD_TESTS=True .. ` for release.
# docker
A docker image is available on docker hub https://hub.docker.com/r/dicegroup/tentris_server. Usage instructions are provided there.
